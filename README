;;; Commentary:

;; To use Phpcs with Emacs, you will need Phpcs installed and available on
;; your path.  You should be able to do

;; $ phpcs

;;; Usage

;; Add to your Emacs config:

;; (require 'flymake-phpcs)
;; (add-hook 'php-mode-hook 'flymake-phpcs-load)

;; How to customize the Coding Standard:

;; (custom-set-variables
;;  '(phpcs-coding-standard "PSR2"))

;; making sure that flymake-phpcs.el is on your load-path.  If not,
;; also add to your config:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/path/to/flymake-phpcs.el")

;;; Debugging

;; If Phpcs isn't working for any reason, execute

;; M-x set-variable flymake-log-level <RET> 3

;; and you will see what is going wrong listed in the *Messages*
;; buffer.

;;; Changelog

;; v1.0 -- Release first.
